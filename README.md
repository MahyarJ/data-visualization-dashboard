# Data Visualiztion Dashboard

> Technical Aspects - by Mahyar Jamalabadi

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).- The project is available on my [Github](https://github.com/MahyarJ/data-visualization-dashboard).- The project UI is also available on [Netlify](https://dv-dashboard.netlify.app//).

## Design

- I put a good effort to fulfill the entire design mockups to make everything deployable right out of the box. Be Pixel-Perfect!
- The design itself has no color guid on the charts, so I implemented a new type of checkboxes that handles color itself
